# Dackage's SM64 LiveSplit AutoSplitter

Wanting to add the ability to use course labels, I looked into making my autosplitter version. This is
	functionally very similiar to aglab2's "LiveSplit.SuperMario64.asl" autosplitter and is what I built off of
	https://github.com/aglab2/LiveSplitAutoSplitters

Notes
- this is only made for binary ROM hacks of the US version of SM64. (Which is most hacks) Decomp hacks will not work
- only full game speedruns were in mind in making this. Stage RTA may not work well

New features and changes
- can use course labels instead of level id's e.g. [C1], [B1], or [WC]. You're still able to use level id's if desired.
	See the bottom of the readme for a complete list
- can now use multiple split conditions e.g. "get toad (20) and enter [C8]".
- split conditions can now be anywhere in the split name. (Previously they had to be at the end)
- added the option to split on grand stars that are a warp. Useful for categories that don't end on fadeout
	like Star Road 0/80 Star

Small fixes
- key splits no longer require a star count condition
- skipping a split after collecting a star won't autosplit on level change
- fix for the autosplitting not always working after water star/key animations

Retained features
- ability to split on final star, reset, key, star count, or level id
- compatibility with a variety of emulators including the many Project64's and parallel launcher
- delete file A on reset
- Last Impact mode
- igt

Removed features
- split on music change is removed for now, but I've never seen anyone use this

----------
Conditions
----------

Conditions are not case sensitive

- for a reset split, add "R" or "reset"
- for a key split, add "key"
- to add a star count condition, add it with parentheses e.g. (10) or (128)
- to add a level id/label condition, add it with square brackets e.g. [9] or [C1]

For key and star count splits, there are 4 options for split timing. Level change is the default for golds accuracy but
	there's also xcam, grab, and classic
- classic is the aglab autosplitter behavior. It will split after a fadeout or after Mario is actionable after the save
	prompt for a nonstop star/key. This is most useful for stars that warp you back to the same level.
- to specify which split option you want, you can add -x or -xcam for xcam, -g or -grab for grab, -c
	or -classic for classic

All conditions must be separate from other words/terms in the split names (meaning separated by a space or other whitespace)
	For Example:
- in "key 1 fight" a key keyword would be recognized, but not in "key1 fight"
- in "enter [OW2]" a level label would be recognized, but not in "enter [OW2]!"
- in "side star (35) + R" a reset keyword and a star count would be recognized, but not in "side star(35) +R"

----------
Common Issues
----------
- "keys are not working." Keys only work on File A at the moment
- "it didn't split after collecting an overworld star like toad or red coins." This is because my autosplitter waits for a level change by default.
	You can add a "-c" or "-classic" on the end of the split name, or plan for it to split on a level change instead. If you want it to
	behave like this by default, you can change the "vars.SplitOption_Default" from "level" to "classic" in the .asl file

-------------
Course Labels
-------------

Below are the course labels included by default. They are not case sensitive
- the easiest way to find level id's that aren't obvious is probably STROOP. Add the "Misc" tab if it isn't there
	already, then look for "Stage Index." Then you can match that number with the numbers below. Decomp hacks won't work.

ASL File Customization
----------------------

There are additional settings you can customize, though for now it must be done in the .asl file
- any basic text editor will do, but I've been using Notepad++. If you do, change the language to C#
	so that it looks nicer.
- .asl uses C# code (.NET Framework 4.8.1)

The settings were made to be easy to change
- the default key and star count split option can be changed. Can use -l or -level for level change if
	you change this. Look for:<br />
	vars.SplitOption_Default = "level";<br />
	
- you can add or remove specific key or reset keywords. Look for:<br />
	vars.ResetKeywords = new string[] { "R", "reset" };<br />
	vars.KeyKeywords = new string[] { "key" };<br />
	
- you can add or remove course labels as desired. Note that different areas within a level share the
	same level id. Look for:<br />
	#region Add course labels<br />
